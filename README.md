# Bike-Sharing-Project
A deep learning model that predicts the behavior of renting bikes for a bike rental shop. 
This project has been completed through the Deep Learning Nanodegree program from Udacity. 

The dataset files are the hour.csv and day.csv holding records of the data needed to build this model. 

The Predicting_bike_sharing_data holds most of the code needed to preprocess and test the data. 

And lastly the my_answers file holds the code that describes the structure of the model.
